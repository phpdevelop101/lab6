/*
 * The global $_FILES will contain all the uploaded file information.

 * $_FILES['userfile']['name']
The original name of the file on the client machine.

$_FILES['userfile']['type']
The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this information. An example would be "image/gif". This mime type is however not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value for granted.

$_FILES['userfile']['size']
The size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.

$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']
The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file was stored on the server.

$_FILES['userfile']['error']
The error code associated with this file upload.

Be sure your file upload form has attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" otherwise the file upload will not work.

#important to only allow upload for files that don't affect your PHP code. (or only those files you need)

    #now if the user uplaoded an allowed format, we want to know what format that was
    #the following variable will store the extension, all in lower-case
    #substr() is a function that takes only a portion of a string - we need only what comes after the dot
    #we need to get everything after the LAST dot, looking for the extension
    #strrpos returns the position of the last occurrence of a substring in a string
    #we use the file name and a dot to find the extension: strrpos($_FILES['upload']['name'], '.')
    #but we also need to add one space to ignore the dot, so we write +1 at the end.
    #strtolower function changes all capital letters to lower-string so JPG becomes jpg and it fits your whitelist
    #you should take the entire string and put it in 'strtolower'

 //neddle is what you looking for.+1 skip the dot
//strtolower($string)//make string lower case
//substr($string, $start)//return a part of the string//take the dot and everything after it

    #if it does not pass, then we give an error.
